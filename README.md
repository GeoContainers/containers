# Geocontainer Dockerfiles

The Geocontainer project is an independent place to collaborate on Dockerfiles from the geo/spatial domain.

For more on the project see http://geocontainers.org.

## Contribute

Through inspired by [Biodocker](http://biodocker.org) this project does not have any rules for requirements for Dockerfiles. Which of course does not mean, that badly written Dockerfiles will be part of this repository. For know, everything in this repo will only have to "work".

This probably changes with time as the community and experiences grow (hopefully).

So to contribute a Dockerfile or documentation under the Geocontainers label, please simply [open a pull request](https://github.com/geocontainers/dockerfiles/pull/new/master).

## Guidelines
